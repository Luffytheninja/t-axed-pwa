# AIO Portfolio (Vibe-OS)

A highly stylized, OS-like portfolio experience built with Next.js 15, Tailwind 4, WebGL, and Framer Motion. This digital artifact serves as the primary portfolio for **AIO** (Luffytheninja), showcasing multidisciplinary design and vibecoding experiments.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4 (Custom "Nostalgic Tech" Palette)
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Motion**: Framer Motion
- **Visuals**: React Three Fiber (Grain Shader), Custom Canvas Interactions

- **Fonts**: JetBrains Mono & EB Garamond (via Google Fonts)

## Features

- **Window Management System**: Draggable and focusable windows with spring physics.
- **Cinematic Portfolio Browser**: A file-explorer style gallery with high-fidelity "Story Mode" viewing for artifacts.
- **Signal Interpreter**: An AI-chat style assistant that guides visitors through the portfolio.
- **Desktop Environment**: Functional icons, scattered layout, and crosshair interactions.
- **Easter Eggs**: Try exploring the system deeply.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Design Philosophy
Built on the principles of **"Vibecoding"**—where friction, texture, and mood are prioritized alongside function. The interface mimics a discovered digital artifact rather than a standard commercial website.
